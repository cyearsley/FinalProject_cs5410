This project is for the CS5410 final project at Utah State University.
Author: cnyearsley@gmail.com

HOW TO START GAME:
Required: Node.js - v6.9.4, NPM - 3.10.10
Execute the following commands in the root of the game.
	i) npm install
	ii) npm start (or you could simply use: "node server.js")
	iii) in the browser, go to the url: http://localhost:8000/play

HOW TO PLAY THE GAME:
	At the start screen, you can do one of four things:
		i) Options / Controls
			Here, you will be able to re-config your controls, and set your user name (which I recommend doing)

		ii) Highscores
			Here you will be able to see all highscores saved to the server.
				If you have troubles with this, try and pull the file from: https://github.com/cyearsley/FinalProject_cs5410/blob/release-prep-1.3/highscores.txt

		iii) Credits
			Just credits

		iv) Multiplayer Lobby
			This is where the magic happens, I'll describe this in more detail...

HOW TO USE MULTIPLAYER:
	It is pretty straightforward: In the Multiplayer Lobby, you will be able to see all users connected to the lobby,
	from here you can either create a world OR join an existing world.
	Once in the world, you will be able to navigate with the keys you configured (AWSD by default).
	You will also be able to manipulate the terrain with the left, middle, and right mouse buttons (further instructions are in the play scene itself at the bottom left corner.)

Resources Used
Most art (especially the tiles) were created by me.
Other artwork (exluding the Terrar logo) were initially found on opengameart.org
The Terrar Logo was initially found on http://terraria.wikia.com/wiki/File:Terraria_logo_by_dak47922-d4l8t7v.png, I did however edit this image to my own needs.

Best,
